# Games
This is a small repository with all the small games I coded in python.

### 1. Snake Game
It was coded during December of 2020.

### 2. Tetris
I have yet to finish coding the game, but I worked mostly on it during January 2021.

### 3. Chess
This is the biggest game and although it is still a work in progress, I began working on it during May 2021.

### 4. Tennis Game
This is a simple coding game that I made when I first learned about pygame in April 2020.

### 5. Multiplayer Game
This is a small game where 2 players can, through their computers and wifi(have to be on same wifi), play together with tanks, almost like a 2D version of World Of Tanks(except much worse). The game is far from done and I hope to be able add a way to play through servers, rather than wifi and solve some bugs. I also hope to be able to add more players and add some walls.
